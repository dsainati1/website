# About Me
<div class="about-me">
<img style="float: right; margin: auto;" class="profile-picture" src="/picture.jpg" width="200">

<p>
I am a first-year PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/">PLClub</a> at the <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>,
where I study type systems and program verification. 
My research is supported by the <a href="https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships">NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship</a>
</p>

<p>
Previously, I worked in industry at <a href="https://opensource.fb.com/">Meta</a> and the <a href="https://flow.com/">Flow Foundation</a>.
Before that, I did my B.S. and M.Eng. at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a>.

# Other Work

* At Meta, I worked on the [Flow](https://flow.org/) type checker for JavaScript. 
At one point I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/flow-type/sound-typing-for-this-in-flow-d62db2af969e) about it. 

* At Flow, I worked on the [Cadence](https://cadence-lang.org/) smart contract programming language. 
Some contributions here that I am particularly proud of are [Entitlements](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/1.0/language/access-control#entitlements) and [Attachments](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/1.0/language/attachments).

* In undergrad, some classmates and I released a mobile game called [Underhand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand&hl=en_US&pli=1).
We haven't maintained it at all, and at some point it was delisted from the Apple Store, but if you're interested you can probably figure out a way to emulate it.
