# About Me

I am a second-year PhD student in the [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/),
where I study type systems and language design with [Benjamin Pierce](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/) and [Stephanie Weirich](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~sweirich/). 
My research is supported by the [NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/graduate-fellowships).

Previously, I worked in industry at [Meta](https://opensource.fb.com/) and the [Flow Foundation](https://flow.com/).
Before that, I did my B.S. and M.Eng. at [Cornell](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/), where I was advised by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/). 

You can reach me at [sainati@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:sainati@seas.upenn.edu), or take a look at my [CV](./CV.pdf).

# Other Work

* I wrote some [lecture notes](./Effects_Lecture_Notes.pdf) about type and effect systems for a lecture I taught in Penn's type systems course (CIS 6700).

* At Meta, I worked on the [Flow](https://flow.org/) type checker for JavaScript. 
At one point I wrote a [blog post](https://medium.com/flow-type/sound-typing-for-this-in-flow-d62db2af969e) about it. 

* At Flow, I worked on the [Cadence](https://cadence-lang.org/) smart contract programming language. 
Some contributions here that I am particularly proud of are [Entitlements](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/1.0/language/access-control#entitlements) and [Attachments](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/1.0/language/attachments).

* In undergrad, some classmates and I released a mobile game called [Underhand](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.cornell.gdiac.underhand&hl=en_US&pli=1).
We haven't maintained it at all, and at some point it was delisted from the Apple Store, but if you're interested you can probably figure out a way to emulate it.
